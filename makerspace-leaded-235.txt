// About this profile:
// - designed to reflow leaded solder paste using Kester Reflow Profile for 
//   alloys: Sn63Pb37 or Sn62Pb36Ag02
// - typical runtime of 5:30 minutes on the Makerspace reflow oven.  Measured 
//   from start of run, to max reflow temperature reached, ending on drop to 183C liquidus
// - attempts to reach 235C peak
// - typical observed measurements for this profile:
//   pre-heat time (start to 140C): 100s
//   soak time (140C to 165C): 100s
//   reflow time (183C to peak, peak to 183C): 90s
//   total runtime (start to peak, peak to 183C): 5min 20s

// Notes:
// 1. Comment lines can start with # or //
// 2. Comments can start after a token (e.g. Door close 1s // Close the oven door in 1 second)
// 3. Tokens are case-insensitive
// 4. End of line character can be CR or LF (or both, in any order)
// 5. Number delimiters can be any non-digit character (30/40/50 = 30,40,50 = 30 40 50)
// 6. When reading in profile files, Arduino's Serial Monitor will show debugging information

// The name of this profile
Name "Makerspace Leaded paste 235~C"
// The title is displayed in the top-left corner
Title "Reflow"
// Show a graph on the display, including the 183 degC liquidus temperature
Show graph to 250C for 600 seconds
Graph divider at 183C
// The deviation (in Celsius) above which to abort
Deviation to abort 25C
// The maximum temperature.  If exceeded, reflow will abort and the oven door opens
Maximum temperature 250C
// Set a maximum duty cycle to avoid damage to the oven (bottom/top/boost)
Maximum duty 100/80/80

// Close the oven door if it isn't already
Close door over 1 second
// Stop the timer for now, until the temperature is below 50C
Stop timer
// Wait for the oven to cool to get consistent results
Display "Waiting for oven to cool to 50~C"
Wait until below 50C

Start timer
Start plotting at 0 seconds

// ============= PRE-HEAT =============
Display "Phase: Pre-Heat to 140C at MAX power"
// pre-heat as fast as possible (limited only by "Maximum duty" command above)

Element duty cycle 100/100/100
// stop the max heating at 120C as the heating elements have thermal inertia that will 
// continue increasing the oven temperature to the desired 140C
Wait until above 120C
Maintain 140C for 20 seconds 

// ============= SOAK =============
Display "Phase: Soak 140C to 165C"
// want 100s soak time
// Select the heating bias (bottom/top/boost)
Bias 100/50/80
// Slow increase in temperature during soak
// want 100s total soak time, but PID always takes longer than programmed,
// so set a shorter time
Ramp temperature to 165C in 80s  

// ============= REFLOW =============
Display "Phase: Reflow (boost) for 10s"
// Force the elements on for a short while to get a quick increase in
// the temperature of the elements (bottom/top/boost)
// This will be limited by the "Maximum duty" command above
Element duty cycle 100/100/100
Wait for 10 seconds
Display "Phase: Reflow to 235C"
// Select the heating bias (bottom/top/boost)
Bias 100/80/70
// Ramp up the temperature for reflow.
// want 60s to reach max temperature, but PID always takes longer than programmed,
// so set a shorter time.  Also, the elements have inertia which takes the temperature 
// higher than the programmed temperature.  Set a lower temperature to compensate.
Ramp temperature to 225C in 50s

// Hold the temperature at peak for 15 seconds
Display "Phase: Reflow - hold for 15s"
Maintain 235C for 15 seconds

// ============= COOLING =============
Display "Phase: Cooling"
// Turn the elements off (bottom/top/boost)
Element duty cycle 0/0/0
// Open the oven door
Open door over 10 seconds
// Wait for the door to open
Wait for 10 seconds
// Wait for the temperature to drop below liquidus
Wait until below 183C
Stop timer

// Wait for the temperature to drop below 100C
Wait until below 100C

// Boards can be removed now
Display "Boards can be removed now"
// Play a tune that the reflow is done
Play tune
// Wait for the temperature to drop further
Wait until below 50C

// Reflow is done now
Display "Reflow complete!"
// Close the oven door
Close door over 3 seconds
